## Full Stack Trivia

A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out. 

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

Completing this trivia app will give you the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling your future applications to communicate with others. 

### Backend

### Frontend
